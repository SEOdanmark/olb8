If we&#39;re talkin&#39; &#39;bout stock market or somethin&#39; like that, then I&#39;d say no. The last decade has been very volatile for the city, and there&#39;s been some unrest in recent years. Not the best environment for investing money.

First off, it&#39;s important to know what kind of house you&#39;re looking for. Are you looking for a single family home or would a multifamily residence better suit your needs? Knowing this will help narrow down your search.
